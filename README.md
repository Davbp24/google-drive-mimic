GOOGLE DRIVE CLONE PRACTICE PROJECT

- Hello Everyone! This project was a practice project that I followed to introduce myself to new technologies and begin a gradual move towards
- a deeper understanding of them.

This project used Typescript, Javascript, React, NPM, Appwrite(database, storage), ShadCDN (similar to npm), and much more. 
- My personal pursuit to learn and expose myself to different technologies and programming practices was done
- with the intention of experiencing a full-developed full-stack project.
